Today at work, we got into a conversation about what was the best AI chatbot. Everyone had their own camp and their reasons for which one was best. Best is subjective, so what do you think is the best chatbot? Prompt:

> We're going to be writing a web application for my personal blog: https://starikov.co. My website is a black website with white text. My website is a ghost site. This application should be self contained to a single div, it shouldn't leak design into the greater website/on the main feed. It should be very modern, clean, and sleek. It should be good all around, scaleable in every way. It should be generally accessible. It should use modern web standards, and work great in Chrome and Safari. Again, don't like into the greater sit: it should be a single div with all of it's style and such contained, injectable into a Ghost post. It should be fully text-width.Â 

> This is going to be a fully interactive trivia game. I should be able to hardcode a javascript dictionary with quiz show questions. It can be anywhere between 1 (a freebie, you get free points) to 10 options. It should keep track of how many you get correct. You should be able to specify bonus rounds, by default make the last two bonus. It should be interactive with animations, especially congrulatory messages. You should be able to click any option but only accept answers when the user clicks a submit button.

> At the end please show a congratulatory messages with their final score. It should break down every question they got right or wrong through the quiz. The more questions they get right the more grandiose the congrats animation.

> Preload this game show with Google trivia, heavily focusing on ChromeOS questions. Please make it scaling in difficulty. 10 questions.

> It should be a modern website with modern styling. Please keep it a div self contained to a ghost site.

I choose ChromeOS in honor of my bff Stefan.
