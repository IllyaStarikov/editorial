# Meet Zuko
> The crowned prince of the Fire Nation ðŸ”¥

I want you to meet the newest addition to our family: Zuko.

Zuko comes to us from [The Dancing Cat](https://www.thedancingcat.org) rescue. They were tremendously knowledgeable and thorough, and we really appreciate how they guided us through the adoption process. He did have to part from his mom, Candy, which made us incredibly sadâ€”we almost walked away with both of them.

The Dancing Cat does something really smart: they offer a trial adoption period of approximately two weeks to ensure everyone's a good fit. After those two weeks, we knew he was right for us and we were right for him. He transformed from a guest in our home to the prince of the castle (though Bodie remains the undisputed king).

If I had to describe Zuko in three words, they would easily be:

1. **Sweet** â€“ because he loves cuddling and being held
2. **Fiery** â€“ because he definitely has an attitude
3. **Needy** â€“ because he has to be around us or Bodie at all times

He's settled into comfortable routines and gets along wonderfully with Bodieâ€”they can often be found playing together throughout the day. Mallory hasn't warmed up to Zuko quite as much, but that's pretty expected for her; she's always been our independent cat.

When he's not wrestling with Bodie, Zuko can be found exploring every corner of our house, swatting his toys around, or chewing on things he shouldn't (like the zippers on our jackets). He's still a kitten, so he's bursting with energy. We try to give him plenty of outlets for all that enthusiasm. He goes crazy for the laser pointer.

Yesterday marked a milestone: we officially took him outside on a leash for the first time, and he did great. I think he's going to love being an outdoor cat.

We're excited for all the years ahead with Zuko, our fierce little warrior. We can't help but smile at how perfectly his name suits himâ€”fiery spirit and all. Bodie, channeling his inner Iroh, gently guides hot-headed Zuko toward enlightenment (or at least toward the scratching post instead of the kitchen chairs). Like the beloved uncle who never gave up on his nephew, Bodie demonstrates endless patience as Zuko learns that honor isn't about being the fiercest hunter, but about being the best companion.
