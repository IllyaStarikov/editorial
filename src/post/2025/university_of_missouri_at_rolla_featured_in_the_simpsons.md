# University of Missouri At Rolla featured in The Simpsons
It’s not often my college — Missouri University of Science and Technology, aka Missouri S&T — makes an appearance in pop culture. When it does, it’s kind of a big deal; at least me.

So I was incredibly happy to discover that Missouri S&T was [featured in the Simpsons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rolla/comments/131hg4/umr_on_the_simpsons/). This Reddit thread is where I found this, which lays out the premise:

> Lisa was increasing her college tuition budget by gambling online. Every time she won more money, she changed her sweater to a "better" college. We [Rolla] are better than Springfield Community College and worse than Harvard, Yale, Oxford. — u/bullhonke

It’s fitting, at least for those of us who had the great honor of studying under the legendary [Clayton Price](https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/price/). Price taught computer science and was well-known for making his (difficult) assignments based on his favorite show: the Simpsons. I assume many former-students have nightmares in the middle of the night, trying to articulate Bart and Homer doing something comical into code.

The irony is this episode aired 2012, and I never saw this during my tenure. Additionally this was almost a decade after Mr. Price famously got rid of his television, so clearly he never saw it either. But it’s heartwarming to us Missouri S&T alumni to know we existed in a timeline where this episode, Price, and our experiences at Rolla co-existed.
