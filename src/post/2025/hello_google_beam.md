It’s Google I/O time, which means time for product announcements! I was happy to see Starline make the cut within the first ten minutes. 

Or should I say, Google Beam? ✨

Instead of a flat webcam view, Beam uses AI with a special curved “light-field” screen and multiple cameras to recreate each person as a life-sized, 3D image. The effect is like talking through a clear window: your remote friend or colleague looks as if they’re really sitting right across from you, not just appearing flat on a screen.

> Behind the scenes, an array of six cameras captures you from different angles. And with AI, we can merge these video streams together and render you on a 3D light field display with near-perfect headtracking down to the millimeter and at 60 frames per second, all in real time.

## Roundup

> when you're using Beam the best part of it is that you don't have to wear anything it's not like AR glasses or VR headsets it's just a giant TV with a bunch of custom cameras and sensors that Google has developed and the end experience is that you're looking at a 3D hologram of someone. — The Verge
