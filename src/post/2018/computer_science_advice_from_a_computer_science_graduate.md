# Computer Science Advice From A Computer Science Graduate
Reminiscing on my academic career, there are certainly things I did right; however, there are certainly things I did wrong. Aside from the rights and the wrongs, there are things I had wished I had done sooner. Today, I hope to shed some light on some of the these things.

For context, as of a month ago I am an alumni of [Missouri University of Science and Technology](http://www.mst.edu), and engineering college in Missouri. It has equipped me very well in mathematics[^1], physics[^2], and computer science[^3]. I wrote roughly 159,141 lines of code in college, so I feel as if I got my money’s worth. Thanks to Missouri S&T, I have a fairly diverse background in many things.

Below is advice I would recommend to anyone currently studying computer science (or programming in general).

## Get A Computer You’ll Love 
I got a [13-inch MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp691?locale=en_US) my freshmen year of college, and it was the best decision I made in my academic career. At the beginning of my senior year, I got a [15-inch MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP756?locale=en_US) with an [LG UltraFine 5K Display](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HKN62LL/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display), it was the second best decision I made in my academic career.

Getting a great computer is not just to speed up compile times; it’s to make programming more enjoyable. During a typical programming day, I’ll be on my computer 8-12 hours. 33%-50% of my my time that day will be on a computer. Reducing friction 33%-50% of the day is almost invaluable.

Although a MacBook was perfect for me, it might not necessarily be right for anyone else. Find a computer you love, you won’t regret it.

## Learn LaTeX
LaTeX was probably my most used programming tool in my academic career. It was a Swiss Army knife for any form of documents I might need:

- Notes
- Presentations
- Assignments
- Papers
- Documentation 

Some samples of my LaTeX work can be found [under my project page](http://freneticarray.com/projects/).

## Learn A Different Language
At Missouri S&T, [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) is the first (and during my time there, the only) language one learned. The problem with this? One language, whether it be the can-all that C++ is, is not always appropriate for the job. There were times where Python was a much better choice. Sometimes it was C. Sometimes it was Swift. It all depends on the project. My recommendation is if you learned Python, learn C++. If you learned C++, learn Python. From there, find languages that will be useful for your domain.

## Learn Your Text Editor
I didn’t pick up Vim until I was a junior; this was a giant mistake on my part. Vim didn’t just make it easier to delete a particular line of code; Vim made it easier to open files quickly, explore codebases faster, modify text quicker, etc.

Vim is not for everyone. Vim might not be right for you. Find a good text editor, and learn everything you can about it. It’ll make the friction of actually writing code much less.

## Take Higher-Level Classes Early
Nearly all Computer Science programs require one to take higher-level classes as electives; in our school, it was roughly five graduate level classes. I made the mistake of taking all five my last year. 

*Emphasis on mistake.*

Take them early; chances are you won’t be bogged down with job finding, apartment hunting, or the likes. Taking 18 hours, with three very difficult classes, in one term is not something I would wish on anyone.

## Find Interests In Computer Science
When you find topics that interest you in Computer Science, chances are you will like your major more. I found a particular interests in AI related courses, but it is not for everyone. Computer Science has a breadth of interesting topics; check to see what your school has to offer, like:

- Security
- AI
- Data Mining and Big Data
- Machine Learning
- Databases
- UI/UX Design

## Find Interests Outside Computer Science
Burnout is a serious issue in the industry. It can be a serious issue inside school as well. Foster passions outside of the classroom. Maybe join a design team, fraternity, or a sports team. There will be plenty of time at work to learn new things.

In addition, take genuinely interesting elective (not the easy ones). I learned I had an interest in Physics, and I carry that with me everyday.

## Intern As Much As Possible
Internships are not only a gentle introduction into the industry, but a great way to determine what job you will want outside of school. Internships are often joked as “A 12-week interview processes”, and this can be true. If you find a good company that you can do good work for, it’s a great way to secure a job upon graduation. 

## Have Fun
The most important lesson I learned in college was to have fun (in moderation). College is all about learning who you are, what you want out of life, how to interact with others, and how to simply have fun. Lessons you learn in college will get carried over after graduating. Why not use this time to make life-long friends, create great memories, and know who you really are?

## In Closing
This guide is not comprehensive; but it’s something I wish I read when I was starting. There’s always room to grow, so figure out what works for you. Do what makes you happy.
