# Avoid The Mac App Store via The Terminal
I avoid the Mac App store as much as possible. It’s buggy. It’s slow. Apps are getting pulled from it left and right. But, I could not avoid it permanently because of software updates. As macOS Sierra 10.5 rolled out, I clicked on the App Store, followed by updates, and...

I could not get the updates page opened. Killed App Store. Restart computer. Everything.

After doing some [research](https://www.google.com/search?q=terminal+update+software), I discovered there is a way to update software from the terminal: `softwareupdate`. So, after running one command (`sudo softwareupdate -iv`), I am writing this for the latest version of macOS Sierra.
