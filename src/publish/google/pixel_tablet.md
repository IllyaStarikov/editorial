> Meet the new Google Pixel Tablet that’s helpful in your hands and at home.

The Google Pixel Tablet is a home-focused Android tablet released in 2023. It features a 10.95-inch LCD touchscreen display (2560 × 1600 resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio) with around 500 nits of brightness. The tablet’s build uses an aluminum frame with rounded edges and a nano-ceramic coating inspired by porcelain, which gives it a soft matte texture for better grip. Google offers the Pixel Tablet in three colors – Porcelain (off-white), Hazel (gray-green), and Rose (pink)​. The device also houses four built-in speakers (two on each side) for stereo audio output during media playback.

Under the hood, the Pixel Tablet is powered by Google’s Tensor G2 chipset (the same processor used in the Pixel 7 series smartphones)​. It comes with **8GB of RAM and either 128 GB or 256 GB** of internal UFS 3.1 storage (non-expandable). The tablet ships with Android 13 and includes **Google’s Titan M2 security chip**, with Google promising at least **five years of security updates for the device**. Power is supplied by a built-in 27 Wh battery (about 7020 mAh) that is rated for up to **12 hours of video streaming** on a full charge. Connectivity is Wi‑Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 only (the Pixel Tablet does not offer cellular/LTE support)​. For cameras, it has an 8 MP front camera and an 8 MP rear camera, both with fixed focus and primarily intended for video calls or simple photos​. A fingerprint scanner is integrated into the power button for secure unlocking​.

Google has optimized the Pixel Tablet’s software for a large screen experience. Many popular apps (such as YouTube, Spotify, and Disney+) have improved layouts on the tablet’s display, and a Google TV app comes preloaded to make it easy to browse and stream video content on the big screen​. The tablet supports multitasking features like split-screen mode, allowing two apps to run side by side, and it offers accurate voice typing and other Google AI features for convenient hands-free input​. It is also compatible with USI 2.0 stylus pens, enabling users to draw or take notes with a supported active stylus​ (no stylus is included in the box). Notably, the Pixel Tablet supports multiple user profiles – each family member can have their own account with separate apps, settings, and personalizations on the device​. This multi-user support underlines its role as a shared home tablet.

One of the Pixel Tablet’s signature features is its **Charging Speaker Dock**, which comes included with the tablet​. The tablet can be placed on this dock via pogo pin connectors (held in place magnetically), which both charges the device and boosts its audio. The dock contains a full-range speaker that provides significantly more bass and room-filling sound compared to the tablet’s built-in speakers. When the Pixel Tablet is docked, it automatically enters Hub Mode, functioning like a smart display for the home. In this mode, the tablet can show a hands-free Google Assistant interface, smart home controls, and even a digital photo frame or clock on the screen​. Users can control smart devices (lights, thermostats, doorbells, etc.) directly from the tablet’s hub interface, similar to a Google Nest Hub. Additionally, the Pixel Tablet is the **first tablet with Chromecast built-in**, allowing you to cast music or videos from your phone to the tablet’s screen when it’s on the dock​. This dual functionality lets the Pixel Tablet serve as both a personal tablet and a communal smart home display depending on how it’s being used.
