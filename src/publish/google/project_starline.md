**Google Project Starline** is an experimental 3D telepresence system designed to make video calls feel as natural as face-to-face conversations. First unveiled in 2021, it combines advanced hardware and software to create a “magic window” effect – users on a Starline call see each other life-size and in three dimensions, as if they’re together in the same room​. The goal is to bridge physical distance and help people (from coworkers to family members) feel truly present with each other, even when they are cities or countries apart​.

Project Starline uses a mix of **3D imaging, AI, spatial audio, and a special light-field display** to produce its lifelike communication experience. Multiple cameras and sensors capture a person’s shape and movements from different angles, and Google’s systems process this data in real-time. The other user sees a **life-size, three-dimensional image** of the person on a large light-field screen, which creates an illusion of depth without the need for any VR headsets or glasses​. This setup lets participants talk, gesture, and make eye contact naturally through the display, with spatial speakers recreating sound as if it’s coming from the person’s direction. In practice, it feels like sitting across from someone at a table – the technology fades into the background, and the conversation feels remarkably **immersive and natural**​.

Project Starline is still in the **prototype stage**, but it has made notable progress. Initially the system was confined to a few Google offices, relying on custom-built equipment and even a booth-like enclosure​. Googlers spent thousands of hours testing it internally, and early demos with select partners showed promise – participants found that meetings in Starline felt much more like real in-person meetings than traditional video calls, with better attentiveness and engagement​. In late 2022, Google expanded testing through an **early access program**, installing Starline prototypes at partner organizations like Salesforce, T-Mobile, WeWork, and a healthcare network, to gather feedback in real workplace scenarios​. A major breakthrough came in 2023 when Google unveiled a **new, streamlined Starline prototype**. Thanks to AI techniques that reduce the need for specialized cameras and depth sensors, the system shrank from the size of a restaurant booth to something resembling a large flat-screen TV​. This slimmer design can more easily fit into offices or conference rooms, bringing Starline closer to a practical product​.

Google is now preparing to bring Project Starline out of the lab and into broader use. In 2024, the company announced a partnership with **HP** to commercialize Starline, with plans to make it available to enterprise customers starting in 2025​. The goal is to integrate Starline’s 3D calling experience with everyday video conferencing tools like Google Meet and Zoom, so that companies can use it for realistic remote meetings via familiar platforms​. Early interest has come from a range of industries – Google has demoed Starline to partners in fields like healthcare, media, and retail, hinting at potential uses from telemedicine consultations to virtual retail experiences​. Over time, as the technology becomes more affordable and accessible, it could also be used for personal communication (for example, helping families connect across long distances) and educational or training settings. **Project Starline offers a glimpse into the future of remote communication**, one where distance is less of a barrier and people can “be there” for important moments without having to travel​.
