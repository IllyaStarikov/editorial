The Garmin GDL-60 is a small panel-mounted datalink module that brings wireless connectivity to an aircraft’s avionics suite. It is part of Garmin’s PlaneSync “connected cockpit” system and works with Garmin avionics (such as GTN™ Xi navigators and G1000®/G1000 NXi flight decks) to connect the aircraft to the outside world​. In practice the GDL-60 acts like an onboard “internet box,” using both a built-in 4G LTE cellular modem and Wi‑Fi radio to link the plane’s systems with Garmin’s cloud services and pilot tablets. This lets the avionics exchange data automatically – for example, it can download chart and database updates or stream weather and traffic directly into mobile apps – without a pilot having to plug in data cards.
Technically, the GDL-60 is a compact device (about 8.72″ x 4.00″ x 1.12″ and 1.5 lb) that mounts in the instrument panel​. It runs on 14/28 V DC aircraft power and is certified for high altitudes up to 55,000 ft. Its hardware includes dual Wi-Fi radios (one access point, one client) using 802.11 b/g/n at 2.4 GHz, plus a multi-band LTE modem covering global 4G frequencies​​. In effect, the GDL-60 creates both an onboard Wi‑Fi network and a cellular data link. The aircraft can thus stay connected on the ground or in flight, subject to cell coverage. Garmin’s documentation notes that the unit “enables PlaneSync technology” via these connections and that its LTE/Wi-Fi link automatically keeps the avionics databases updated.

Once installed, the GDL-60 offers several key features for pilots. One major advantage is automated database updates: Garmin explains that the GDL-60 “offers database downloads directly to the aircraft,” so that new charts and navigation data can download over the air without a pilot present. The system then “auto-synchronize[s] across your avionics at power up,” eliminating manual update chores​. The GDL-60 also logs flight and engine data; after landing it can “transmit flight and engine log data automatically… to secure cloud storage,” where pilots or maintenance crews can review it via the Garmin Pilot mobile app or the flyGarmin web portal​. Another useful feature is remote aircraft monitoring: with the GDL-60 and Garmin Pilot, an owner on the ground can check the airplane’s status from anywhere. The Pilot app can show things like Hobbs and tach times, fuel quantity, battery voltage, outside-air temperature, oil temperature, and even the last known GPS location of the aircraft​. In short, GDL-60 keeps pilots informed about their aircraft’s health and readiness.

Perhaps the most visible benefit is mobile connectivity. The GDL-60 enables Garmin’s Connext system, which streams in-flight data from the panel to pilot devices. For example, it can send ADS-B weather (FIS-B) and traffic, GPS position, and even attitude (AHRS) information to apps like Garmin Pilot or ForeFlight. In fact, Garmin describes that the GDL-60 lets you “stream weather, traffic, AHRS, flight plans and other data from your avionics to flight apps such as Garmin Pilot and ForeFlight”​. Pilots can also transfer flight plans between their tablet and the panel through this link. (With additional hardware, the GDL-60 can even extend to cabin entertainment and SATCOM: for example, pairing it with a SiriusXM receiver enables XM audio tuning via the Pilot app, and it can interface with a Garmin GSR-56 for in-flight texting/voice calls​.) Overall, the Garmin GDL-60 turns a compatible cockpit into a connected cockpit – keeping nav databases current and putting real-time flight and weather data into pilots’ hands through familiar mobile interfaces.
