# Balance üíº/üè°
> Balancing work and life to focus on what matters.

<h2><center><i>Template Version:</i> <b><code>2.1</code></b> | <i>Last Updated:</i> <b><code>2025-06-01</b></code></center></h2>

**The following are my work-life balance preferences. They may evolve over time, so check back occasionally.**

**‚öñÔ∏è TL;DR:** Message me anytime, anywhere‚Äîno need to use delayed sending. I'll respond appropriately. Please minimize meetings. My response times vary, especially during crunch periods. I have an unconventional working style, often sending messages and emails at all hours, but I'm adaptable to anyone's communication style. I value directness, candor, and honesty over diplomacy.

## Communication

My preferred communication channels, in order:

1. üí¨ Chat
2. üì© Email
3. üìÖ Meeting

### üí¨ Chat

* **Message anytime**‚Äîduring meetings, PTO, or outside typical work hours is completely fine.
* **Avoid using delayed sending services**; I prefer quick pings and will manage responses appropriately.

  * However, I'll use delayed sending for non-work-related topics.
* **I don't expect immediate replies** unless it's critical.

  * Generally, I reply within a week, though this might extend to two weeks or a month if I'm in deep-focus mode.
  * I keep messages marked unread when they contain action items.
* [Please avoid messages that only say "hello"](https://nohello.net/).

### üì© Email

* I typically **don't check emails outside of working hours**, but **do send emails anytime**.
* I greatly appreciate a clear **TL;DR** at the top.

### üìÖ Calendar

Core hours represent my standard availability window when you can reliably expect me to be online and responsive. These are the designated times during which:

* I‚Äôm consistently available for meetings‚Ä©* I maintain regular communication and respond promptly‚Ä©* My work schedule is most predictable

*Please note*: While I may occasionally be available outside of core hours, availability during these times is less guaranteed and subject to variability. For time-sensitive matters or scheduled meetings, I recommend booking within core hours to ensure reliable connectivity.

My core working hours (**PST**):

| Day           | From        | To          |
| ------------- |:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Monday**    | **`10:00`** | **`16:00`** |
| **Tuesday**   | **`10:00`** | **`16:00`** |
| **Wednesday** | **`10:00`** | **`16:00`** |
| **Thursday**  | **`10:00`** | **`16:00`** |
| **Friday**    | **`10:00`** | **`16:00`** |


Preferences:

* Schedule at least a *5-minute break* between meetings.
* Provide at least *12 hours‚Äô notice* before scheduling meetings.
* Always include *permission to modify the event*.
* I prefer walking meetings whenever possible.
* I use metadata for the following:
	* `#moveable` for meetings easily rescheduled (e.g., 1:1s).
	* üîÑ for recurring meetings

## Working

* **I typically...**
	* complete **code reviews** within `24 hours`.
	* review **tickets** within `24 hours`.
		* respond to **tickets** within `8-24 hours`.

* **Plain, direct communication suits me best.** I tend to speak very straightforwardly, which can occasionally come across bluntly‚Äîthis isn't intentional, just my natural style. If subtlety or context cues are unclear, be direct. It helps everyone stay aligned.

  * **Honesty over diplomacy**‚Äîclarity and truthfulness lead to better outcomes.

* **I prefer detailed and accurate world models.** Expect me to ask probing questions about technical topics to ensure full understanding.

* **I occasionally have irregular working hours.** If my schedule or timing is problematic, please let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôm flexible.

## Interviewing

* **I complete initial interview ratings within 24 hours and provide full feedback within 48 hours.**

* I use "TC" (The Candidate) to anonymize feedback and minimize bias.

* My rating system uses the following markers:

  * `+` Positive trait
  * `-` Negative trait
  * `-+` Mixed (positive and negative)
  * `*` Additional comment or context

Example rating could be:

```
+ Correctly identified the optimal data structure [XOR Linked List]
+ Choose optimal algorithm [Bogosort],
  + weighted pros [Œ©(1) runtime] and cons [O(‚àû)] of algorithm

- Got the average Œò(n √ó n!) runtime incorrect,
	+ but TC got the memory complexity correct O(1),
	+ and correctly explained why constant space: sorts in-place

-+ Got 75% of the unit tests cases correct, 
   which is average for this problem

* TC had internet issues for 5 minutes in the beginning,
  granted them 5 extra minutes for problem (with TC's permisson)
```
