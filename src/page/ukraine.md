# Ukraine 🇺🇦
> You thought Ukraine was that simple? Ukraine is super. Ukraine is unique. It has endured the steamrollers of history.

---

I was born in **Luhansk, Ukraine**. I grew up enjoying life's simple pleasures — climbing the trees and barns in my grandmother's (*babusia's*) yard, strolling through the city with my mom and our neighbors after dinner, and savoring the humble foods we bought in local shops. When I was six, my mom and I emigrated to the United States. Thanks to the invention of the internet, I have been able to talk with my family ever since, and we were fortunate to visit them again — and even host my grandmother here.

Then the [war in Donbas (2014–2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas_%282014–2022%29) began — the first Russian invasion. I was young and didn't fully understand, but I knew one thing: I wouldn't be seeing my family for a long time.

On **February  24,  2022** Russia launched a full‑scale invasion. Writing this two year later, so much has changed. For many Ukrainians— including me, if you can imagine — this has been the hardest period of our lives. Hopes rise and fall: our president stayed in Kyiv and declared [*«Ми всі тут»* ("I'm here")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa7fXDy5Gdg); our defenders liberated swaths of our land; and the world witnessed Ukrainian courage. Yet every victory comes at a heartbreaking cost that can never truly be repaid.

Every day, I hope for a Ukrainian victory.

**Slava Ukraini. 🇺🇦**
