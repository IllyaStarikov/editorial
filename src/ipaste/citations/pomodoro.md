## Prompt

Write me a pomodoro timer application in html and css. make it super configurable. It should have short breaks and a long break. It should have 7x buttons, in 3x rows. Please use emojis to represent the different states. The buttons are:

Start, Pause, Repeat (which repeats this current cycle of work or rest and goes it to the beginning of the work or rest, still gives credit), Skip (which skips this current rest and wait), Done (which skips to the end and gives credit), Reset (which resets everything), and setting for the settings. The settings should take up like 2x buttons. The buttons should visual what's the current state by using a different shade or depth or cue to represent the current state, and making the button for the next state bigger to show that's what you should do (i.e., pause state-> Start is big and Start state->Pause is big)

At the top there should be countdown timer, an animation like an actual pomodoro timer! This pomodoro timer should animate and reflect the progress of the session. Please make it very good and pretty, it's the logo. Please make this very good. Lots of animation please. under the actual pomodoro timer is a progress bar that's counting down the percentage.

In here should be a counter to show both how many completed work and rest sessions. Settings changes should not change the state and these stats. It should represent true work and true rest, if skip is called it should not count that work in the bar. 

Under the progress bar should be a visual log with timestamps to show what's been done.

make it have sounds and effects. itâ€™s going to be on a black background with white text just fyi but incorporate the idea and colors and things of tomatoes. Add depth and dimension. Add a completion tomato effect when done. Make it modern and cool looking. Add mega style.
