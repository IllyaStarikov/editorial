## Prompt
I want you to create an HTML web page that's injectable into my ghost site. All the code should be self contained in DIVs. Note that it's going on my website, which has a dark background and white text.

I want you to create a symbol directory. I want all the symbols in tables on a page. Hovering over a symbol should preview it and show all of its different and unique codes. Clicking a symbol should copy it to clipboard. This should not include emojis. It should logically group all the symbols in some way. I want pretty much all of unicode in one go. Make it super stylish please. Make it modern, cool. Give it volume and dimension. Make it sleek. Make it easy to navigate the page somehow.
