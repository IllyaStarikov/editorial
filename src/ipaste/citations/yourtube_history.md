# YourTube History

> Sharing whole outputs is confidential due to data sampling of my `watch-history` file.

I have this output from youtube of all my videos. I want you to collect all that I watched in my lifetime and organize it into my top 250 watches. Include the video, url, descriptions, and plays. Hardcode this path as the path to the HTML:

file:///Users/starikov/Documents/archive/Google%20Takeout/YouTube%20and%20YouTube%20Music/history/watch-history.html

Let me know if the HTML is incomplete. I want a python script to parse all of it as efficiently as possible and to print tot he terminal in table format the top

Okay, this was great. Fast and reliable. What I want now is for you to rewrite into HTML/CSS/JS I could embed onto a webpage that someone uploads the file and I process it in Javascript. Expose all the parameters in the web form
