# Peg Solitaire

**Peg Solitaire** is a classic single-player puzzle game where you jump pegs to remove them from the board, aiming to leave as few pegs as possible.

## How To Play

Jump pegs over adjacent pegs to remove them from the board. Your goal is to end with as few pegs as possible - ideally just one.

### Basic Rules
- Click a peg to select it (it will bounce)
- Click an empty hole to jump there
- You can only jump over one adjacent peg into an empty hole
- The jumped peg is removed
- Jumps must be horizontal or vertical (no diagonals)
- Game ends when no valid moves remain

- **Esc** - Stop autosolve or close end screen


## Game Modes

### Board Types
