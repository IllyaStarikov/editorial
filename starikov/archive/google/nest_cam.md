> Nest Cam tells you more about what’s going on inside.

Google’s Nest Indoor Camera is a small home security camera designed for indoor use. It has a compact, rounded body and comes in neutral colors so it can blend into home decor. The camera can sit on a shelf or table using its built-in stand, or be mounted on a wall with the included bracket and screws. It connects to your home Wi-Fi network and streams live video to your smartphone or tablet through the Google Home app.

The camera records full high-definition (1080p) video and uses a wide-angle lens (about 135 degrees) to capture a broad area. It also uses high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging to improve detail in bright and dark parts of the scene, and it has infrared night vision to see clearly even in low light. A built-in microphone and speaker allow two-way communication through the app, so you can listen to and speak with people or pets near the camera. Together, these video and audio features let you keep an eye on a room and even interact with anyone there while you’re away.
One of the camera’s key smart features is motion detection. If the camera detects movement, it automatically sends an alert to your phone. You can then open the live video feed in the Google Home app at any time to check on what’s happening. The camera also has a small LED light (usually green) that turns on when it is recording or streaming. This visual indicator lets people nearby know the camera is active and helps address privacy concerns.

Setup is straightforward and user-friendly. You plug the camera into a standard wall outlet using the supplied USB cable, then open the Google Home app on your phone to complete the setup. The app guides you through connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network and naming the device, so most people can have it running in just a few minutes. This simple process means advanced technical skills are not needed to start using the camera.

As a product, the Nest Indoor Camera adds to Google’s Nest line of smart home security devices. It expands Google’s offerings for indoor monitoring and reinforces the company’s presence in the home security market. Overall reception has been positive, with many users praising its reliable performance, easy setup, and clean, modern design. Many also appreciate its smooth integration with Google’s smart home ecosystem, making it a convenient choice for monitoring a home.
