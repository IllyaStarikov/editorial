# Pixel Buds Pro
Google’s Pixel Buds Pro (released mid-2022) are compact true wireless earbuds with a smooth, stemless design​. Unlike earlier Pixel Buds models, the Pro version drops the “stabilizer arc” wing-tips for a simpler in-ear fit, improving comfort​. Each earbud comes with silicone tips in multiple sizes to ensure a snug seal​. The oval charging case (available in four colors) has a pebble-like shape similar to the Pixel Buds A-Series case (about 10–15% larger)​. Both the earbuds and case are water-resistant (buds IPX4, case IPX2), making them suitable for workouts and light rain​.

The Pixel Buds Pro include:

* Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a transparency (ambient sound) mode, letting you either block out or hear surrounding noise as needed​.

* Hands-free Google Assistant for voice commands (play/pause, volume, etc.) and even on-device translation support in conversation mode​.

* Multipoint Bluetooth pairing (connect to two devices at once) and Google Fast Pair for quick setup between phones, tablets, and laptops​.

* Water/sweat resistance (earbuds rated IPX4) for use during exercise or in light rain​.

The Pixel Buds Pro deliver strong audio and reliable performance. Reviewers note clear, well-balanced sound and effective noise canceling​. They also feature an in-ear detection sensor that automatically pauses audio when you remove an earbud​. Battery life is rated up to about 7 hours per charge with ANC on (11 hours with it off), and the compact case provides roughly two full extra charges (around 30 total hours)​. The case supports both USB-C wired charging and Qi wireless charging​. Connectivity is much improved over earlier Pixel Buds: the earbuds use Bluetooth 5.0 with Google’s Fast Pair and show virtually no dropouts in testing​. They also support automatic device switching (multipoint pairing) between two connected devices​.
