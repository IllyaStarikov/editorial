The **NTG Star2** is a mid-2010s Mercedes-Benz in‑car navigation/infotainment system (part of the COMAND/Audio20 series). In practice it was the NTG5‑generation system used in models like the W205 C‑Class, W222 S‑Class, GLC, etc. For audio and navigation it typically used the standard 7″ (17.8 cm) TFT display and console controller. Importantly, NTG Star2 used **Garmin’s “Map Pilot”** technology for GPS navigation in Audio20-equipped cars – inserting a Garmin SD‑card lets the Audio20 unit run 3D maps and routing​. (The COMAND head unit itself was Mercedes-made, but Garmin supplied the map/database software.)

NTG Star2 debuted around 2014–2015 as the successor to the NTG4.5 COMAND system. Mercedes introduced it on new models (for example, the 2015–2020 C‑Class W205 and later E‑Class and GLC) as **COMAND Online (NTG5)** hardware​. These NTG5/Star2 units featured a built‑in hard drive for media and optional CD/DVD storage. Around 2018–2019 Mercedes began updating Star2 to a new software version called “Star1” (this was essentially a software revision to enable features like Apple CarPlay). As one forum noted, “my new [head unit] is called NTG Star1 and CarPlay works – the old one was NTG Star2”​. (In other words, Star2 was the original NTG5 software on older Audio20 hardware; Star1 was the newer update with smartphone integration.)

Today NTG Star2 systems remain supported through Mercedes accessories and parts. Mercedes still sells **Garmin Map Pilot SD** navigation cards and software updates for NTG5/Star2 systems​. For vehicles that came with NTG Star2, a dealer or owner can purchase official updates (e.g. Europe 2020/2021 map packs) for the Garmin Map Pilot. Mercedes also offered an accessory COMAND Online head unit upgrade with DVD changer – a high-end multimedia unit with a 6‑disc changer and hard‑drive nav that replaces the original unit. In short, the NTG Star2 system remains available on its original models (C‑Class, S‑Class, etc.) and can be serviced or upgraded using genuine Mercedes parts (for example, the COMAND Online unit with DVD changer or Garmin Map Pilot module)​.

While Mercedes-Benz designed the NTG Star2 hardware and user interface, Garmin’s involvement was confined to the navigation content. On Audio20/NTG5 Star2 cars, Garmin supplied the Map Pilot navigation module (SD card and software) that plugs into the Mercedes system​. There is no ongoing Garmin development of NTG Star2 itself – Garmin’s input was the map database and guidance engine. All system updates (DVD/DVD changer upgrades or map updates) are handled through Mercedes-Benz parts (including Garmin-branded map cards sold by Mercedes).
