# Carmel-by-the-Sea, California Journey

Last weekend my partner Taylor turned 32 — happy birthday Taylor. ❤️

Legend has it that Robert Stevenson received his inspiration for Treasure Island (one of my favorite books) while walking the beaches in Carmel.

Upon our arrival, the first thing that caught Taylor’s eye was the style of homes in Carmel. Every home was unique, a cottage or English feel as she described it. It’s a place where every path leads to wonder. After dinner, we got there we got to see a sunset straight from Carmel beech. It was a dream. 

The downtown is quant and polished. The restaurants are all unique and gourmet — you can be confident in almost any order, it’ll be good. The shops have the friendliest services — with passionate associates and sometimes owners there to explain anything and everything. Walking down Ocean Avenue, you feel cared for. Around the downtown area you can find sites such as the [Carmel Mission](https://carmelmission.org) (with mass), [World War I Memories Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea_World_War_I_Memorial_Arch), and a [collection of 17 statues](https://carmelartsanddesign.com/public-art-sculptures/).

Of course, you can’t mention Carmel without talking about the [17-Mile Drive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/17-Mile_Drive). Starting in 1892, the drive is a scenic route beyond imagine. It’s famous for golf — which I’m less interested in — but the [Pebble Beach Golf Links](https://www.pebblebeach.com/golf/pebble-beach-golf-links/) ranks as one of the top golf courses globally; the courses here are so renowned they often host the U.S. open. Here you can also find one of the most photographed trees in the world, the Lone Cypress Tree, which stand alone on it’s ocean-and-stone perch, enduring and defying the winds on a costal cliff. And because it’s California, of course the beeches look like they were drawn on a canvas by a paintbrush.

All in all, Carmel was an amazing place.
