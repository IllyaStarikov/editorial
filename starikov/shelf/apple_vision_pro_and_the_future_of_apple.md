# Apple Vision Pro and the Future of Apple

On February 2nd, 2024 — roughly two months ago — Apple released the Apple Vision Pro. They offered (and continue to offer) free demos, which I highly recommend. Two days after launch, I had went to the Palo Alto Apple Store in the hopes to try a demo; to no avail, all the bookings were full. So I bought one instead.

(The Apple return policy is 14 days, but who am I kidding?)

I had always wanted a reality headset of some kind, but hesitant to buy because every one I had encountered I knew I would try but never use. I knew it would take either a generational leap in technology, or Apple building it to compel me to buy it. Thankfully, I feel like I got both.

It should be noted that I don’t have perfect vision, so things at a distance are blurry. And to this day I haven’t gotten the inserts. However, I didn’t need inserts to experience a lot of the beauty of this product.

Much like the Airpods Max, I think everyone notices the weight first. After swapping out the headband, it’s a reasonable fit. But upon boot, it truly is what it claims. Virtual. Reality. As in reality that’s virtually anything.




<TODO WHY IS IT GREAT>





However, despite all the innovation, I can’t help but group it together with three other product lines.

1. Homepod
2. Airtags
3. Airpods Max

Homepod was released during/after the pinnacle of smart, home assistants: Amazon Echos, Google Home, Sonos, Samsung (which didn’t release). Airtags were released at the tail end of the quarantines and lockdowns, which kinda make sense, unless you’re me who loses everything inside the house. Airpods Max came out of nowhere, much on the back of the whopping success of the regular Airpods.

As with the Apple Vision Pro, you can tell the team behind these products cared. The Homepod sounded great. So did the Airpods Max. And the Airtags were great paired with the larger Find My network.

However, all these products were a mixed bag. [Airpods Max were uncomfortable, broke a lot, had a bra case, couldn’t support high bit rate in Apple’s native music player](https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features). [Airtag has the least functional design of any item tracker in existence](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety). [And the HomePod had Siri](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker).

If any company shipped these, they would be solid products. But Apple’s not any company. They’re filled with the most passionate engineers in the industry. It comes as no surprise that Apple Employee own Apple products: Homepods in their home, which confuses 30 second timers with 30 seconds to Mars; Airpods Max on their desk, which have to be in the case or they die because no power button; or Airtags attached to their bags, [which they might have to drill a hole into because no keyring hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT6mwE6YMDw). People feel these frustrations. The world’s richest company could have made the Homepod more compelling — much like they can afford power buttons and drilling holes. They choose not to.

Genuinely, it feels like they don’t care. Why put out something you don’t care about?

Well, why put out the Homepod? Because everyone else was doing it. Why the tracker? Optimal timing. The Homepod Max? Continuation of Homepod. So, why the Apple Vision Pro?

Let’s speculate from the perspective of Apple leadership in Cupertino: as leadership, we know several things. We know that Apple dominated the mobile era, arguably the most important platform today. We know that Apple wants to maintain relevance in the next platform, as any good tech company would. We know that Apple genuinely cares about Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), embedding it not only in software but in iPhone hardware; a single component in iPhone means Apple is confident in it.

Now let’s look from Apple leadership’s perspective if we were cyclical.

As Apple leadership in Cupertino, California, we know someone right down the street took a massive bet on AR/VR. So much so they introduced a meta brand called Meta. A company we may have had a long standing feud with for over ten years. Wouldn’t it make sense to hedge a small bet of a couple ten-hundred billion (we make ~$1billion/day) to remain relevant in this space? In case this becomes the most important platform of tomorrow?

This is of course the most cynical take, I only make it because I fear it could be a small possibility. Small possibility, given the last three, new product lines. I think the likely take is Apple cares about AR/VR and this is culmination of that. Much like they care about Homepod, Airtags, and Airpods Max. Because they’re made up of people that care. And we’ll see it over time.

But even the people that care most have to make business decisions. Furthermore, it’s often people who care the most end up making the business decisions; that’s how they become the leader in the first place. Especially at a company like Apple.
