# Bodie

**Birthday** May 3rd, 2011

**Nicknames** Mr. Bodie, Bad Cat, Orange Cat

Bodie came into my life after my partner’s parents retired. They asked if we wanted him, and we said “Of course”.

At first, it was not an easy transition. He didn’t get along with Mallory. He gets upset in the middle of the night and cries. He gets upset in the middle of the day and cries.

But now he is an integral part of this family.
