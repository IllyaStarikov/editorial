## Playlists

2. **Secondary** podcasts are there when I want to unplug from current-events and listen to something different.
3. **In Progress** podcasts are podcasts I have started but have not completed. This often happens when there a movie, book, or game is brought up I have not played.
4. **Relax** podcasts, well, help me relax. I often use these to go to bed 
5. **Partner** podcasts can be played with my partner at anytime, likely when commuting together.
