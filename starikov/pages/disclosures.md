# Disclosures ðŸ“œ
> All views and opinions expressed are my own.

**I generally don't critique products, companies, or ideas on this site.** Product reviewers and influencers have that covered, and I prefer to write positive content about the niche subjects that interest me. Good vibes only.

**These views are entirely my own.** They do not reflect the views or positions of my employer or any organization I may be affiliated with. All communications should be understood as coming from me personally and not on behalf of any entity.

**I make mistakes all the time.** I believe the important thing is admitting them, learning from them, and not dwelling on them.

**I use Artificial Intelligence throughout my writing process,** including research, drafting, editing, and media generation. You can generally assume every page has been processed through some AI model, whether wholly written by AI or simply edited with a "proofread this page" query.

**I maintain AI attribution and citations** on a [dedicated page](https://starikov.co/citations/). While I could include an AI disclosure on every post, this would become boilerplate text that detracts from the content. That's why this information is easily accessible in a central location.

**Technical details:** I use [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) for publishing, self-hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/). The following tools enhance the site's functionality:

- [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) for website analytics
- [Prism](https://prismjs.com) for code syntax highlighting
