# Balance 💼/🏡
> Balance doesn't mean doing everything; it means doing the right thing.

**The following are my work-life balance preferences. They are subject to change and may be out of date.**

**⚖️ TL;DR** Message me anytime, anywhere, anyhow. Don’t use send laters with me, I’ll check and message back appropriately. Please avoid meetings. My reply times can vary, especially in crunch time. I have a unique work style — such as sending emails/messages at all times of the day — but I can accommodate anyone. I appreciate directness and candor, I value honesty over diplomacy. 


## Communication

My preferred communication channels are as follows.

1. 💬 Chat
2. 📩 Email
3. 📅 Meeting

### 💬 Chat

- It’s **okay to message** me during a meeting, PTO, or outside working hour
- It’s **okay to not use send later services**, I prefer lower ping times and I manage messages accordingly
	- I will use send later for anything non-work relevant, but **I will opt to not use send later services** to reduce ping times
- Unless critical, I **don’t expect a reply for a week**
	- I usually **expect to reply within a week**
	- If I am in focus mode, my reply time can wain into two weeks-one month
	- I will leave messages marked as unread if there is an action item
- [I prefer messages that don’t just say “hello”](https://nohello.net/).

### 📩 Email 

- I **don’t check email** outside working hours
	- I **do send emails** outside working hours
- I **prefer a TL;DR**

### 📅 Calendar

Core working hours as follows (**PST**).

|               | From | To     |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| **Monday**    | 10:00 | 17:00 |
| **Tuesday**   | 10:00 | 17:00 |
| **Wednesday** | 10:00 | 17:00 |
| **Thursday**  | 10:00 | 17:00 |
| **Friday**    | 10:00 | 17:00 |

- a *5 minute* break between meetings
- a *12-hour notice* before scheduling a meeting
- please include *permission to modify the event*
- prefer walking meetings
- encouraged to use \#hashtags for metadata:
	- `#moveable` for meetings that can easily be moved (i.e., 1:1s)


## Working

- **I prefer plain, direct communication.** I sometimes have a tendency to speak too plainly about things, which may be course but it’s just my nature. *I don’t always pick up on context cues and subtlety.* Don’t hesitate to use plain language around me, I think it’ll ensure everyone is on the same page.
	- **I value honesty over diplomacy.** Don’t worry about how to talk to me, focus on what to talk about.

- **I have a short attention span.** This doesn’t mean I can’t code for prolonged periods of time. I have learned to harness it and it makes me a great engineer. It does mean some considerations in topics such as:
	- *communicating*, such as going off on tangents and sometimes trouble sticking to original points
	- *writing*, where you will see me write half-complete sentences and paragraphs when creating a doc, but it will slowly grow into a full body
	- *coding*, where if I know I have a bit of time on a project I may dive deeper into a stack to break up mundane coding

- **I prefer high-fidelity world models.** Unfortunately this usually means I probe on technical topics.

- **I have irregular work hours from time to time.** If the timing of my chats or emails isn’t working for please let me know!

## Interviewing

- I expect to **complete initial interview ratings within 24 hours, full feedback within 48 hours**.
	
- I use TC as an acronym for The Candidate, to not include names and any bias.

- The bullet points I use for grading a candidate:
	- `+` positive trait
	- `-` negative trait
	- `-+` mixture of negative and positive
	- `*` generate comment/note
	- Example would be:

```
+ Correctly identified the correct data structure 
	and algorithm
+ Was able to weight pros and cons of algorithm X.

- Got the runtime incorrect,
	+ but was to get the memory complexity correct
	
-+ Got 75% of the unit tests cases correct, 
	which is average for this problem

* We had internet issues for 5 minutes in the
	beginning, granted candidate 5 extra minutes
	for problem (with their permisson)
```

## Miscellaneous

- I expect to **complete code reviews finished 24 hours**.
