Hello 👋 — I’m **Illya**. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

This is where I share what’s happening in my life here. These are my words, my experiences, and my thoughts — algorithmically unelevated, unsponsored for flavor.

I can’t predict everything I’ll publish, but I *can* promise to keep it interesting.

> *“It is in the roots, not the branches, that a tree’s greatest strength lies.”*

🌻 **Luhansk, Ukraine** was home for the first six years of my life. My body lives elsewhere, but my family—and my roots—remain there.

🛤️ My mom and I then moved to a small town outside **St. Louis, Missouri**, where I spent my formative years.

⛏️ I graduated from Missouri University of Science and Technology — **Missouri  S&T** — in Rolla. *Go Miners!* During college I spent a summer interning with Garmin in **Los  Angeles, CA**. 🏖️

🍖 After another internship, I accepted my first full‑time role at Garmin and moved to **Kansas City, Missouri** — home of legendary barbecue. [Joe’s  Kansas  City](https://www.joeskc.com/) is still my go‑to, though *Ted Lasso* fans might recognize [Arthur  Bryant’s](https://arthurbryantsbbq.com/).

🌉 A visit to the **Bay  Area** sealed the deal: I joined Google and headed west. My first years here coincided with the pandemic, so I entertained myself by skateboarding and one‑wheeling around Stanford in **Palo  Alto** and exploring **San  Francisco**. Simpler times.
