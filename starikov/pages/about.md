Hello 👋—I’m **Illya**. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

This is where I share what’s happening in my life here. These are my words, my experiences, and my thoughts—algorithmically unelevated, unsponsored for flavor.

I can’t predict everything I’ll publish, but I *can* promise to keep it interesting.

> Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale... if somebody told you I was just your average ordinary guy, not a care in the world... somebody lied. — Peter Parker

🌻 **Luhansk, Ukraine** was home for the first six years of my life. My body lives elsewhere, but my family—and my roots—remain there.

🛤️ [My mom](https://www.larysabernhardt.com) and I then moved to a small town outside **St. Louis, Missouri**, where I spent my formative years.

⛏️ I graduated from Missouri University of Science and Technology—**Missouri  S&T**—in Rolla. *Go Miners!* During college I spent a summer interning with Garmin in **Los  Angeles, CA**. 🏖️

🍖 After another internship, I accepted my first full‑time role at Garmin and moved to **Kansas City, Missouri**—home of legendary barbecue. [Joe’s  Kansas  City](https://www.joeskc.com/) is still my go‑to, though *Ted Lasso* fans might recognize [Arthur  Bryant’s](https://arthurbryantsbbq.com/).

🌉 A visit to the **Bay  Area** sealed the deal: I joined Google and headed west. My first years here coincided with the pandemic, so I entertained myself by skateboarding and one‑wheeling around Stanford in **Palo  Alto** and exploring **San  Francisco**. Simpler times.

🐝 My partner, Taylor, and I met in Kansas City, savoring Guy Fieri’s tacos and watching mechanical bull-riding under the chilly night sky in the Power & Light District. Next thing I knew, I was outnumbered; Taylor brought her multiple cats into my life.

🌐 I have been writing on and off online since  2014—around the same time I first got Wi‑Fi. Since then, I’ve experimented with WordPress, Tumblr, and even hand‑coded sites using raw HTML/CSS (plus a dash of Bootstrap). My pet-projects have included an Apple‑centric blog (thatFruitThing), cheat‑sheets for the trivia hit Trivia  Crack amongst others (Answer Keychain), and the occasional portfolio pages showcasing whatever work I had at the time. None of them stuck; they were hobbies that came and went.

🕸️ Instead of writing what I think people would want to read about, I’ve decided to write what I want to write about. An empty canvas for everything I find interesting.
